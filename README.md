# What is this project about?

As a Technology Education (computers, manufacturing, transportation, healthcare, hospitality, etc.) educator, I wanted a simple catalog of lesson plans that I could use for my high school classes. There seems to be plenty of resources out on the internet already but from my brief search I have been frustrated by pay-walls, quality and consistency of the contents. I also want to easily contribute my own lesson plans for public consumption.

This catalog is my attempt at procuring direct, simple lesson plans that anybody can use for free. Please feel free to contribute your resources to this catalog via pull requests or just submitting an issue.

# Who is this project for?

Educators who teach technical education, or students who are self learners.
